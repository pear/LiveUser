  <summary>User authentication and permission management framework</summary>
  <description>  LiveUser is a set of classes for dealing with user authentication
  and permission management. Basically, there are three main elements that
  make up this package:

  * The LiveUser class
  * The Auth containers
  * The Perm containers

  The LiveUser class takes care of the login process and can be configured
  to use a certain permission container and one or more different auth containers.
  That means, you can have your users' data scattered amongst many data containers
  and have the LiveUser class try each defined container until the user is found.
  For example, you can have all website users who can apply for a new account online
  on the webserver's local database. Also, you want to enable all your company's
  employees to login to the site without the need to create new accounts for all of
  them. To achieve that, a second container can be defined to be used by the LiveUser class.

  You can also define a permission container of your choice that will manage the rights for
  each user. Depending on the container, you can implement any kind of permission schemes
  for your application while having one consistent API.

  Using different permission and auth containers, it's easily possible to integrate
  newly written applications with older ones that have their own ways of storing permissions
  and user data. Just make a new container type and you're ready to go!

  Currently available are containers using:
  PEAR::DB, PEAR::MDB, PEAR::MDB2, PEAR::XML_Tree and PEAR::Auth.</description>

    <notes>Important:
We are migrading away from .sql dumps which were MySQL specific towards the
MDB2 xml schema format. Therefore we have removed the .sql files from the sql
directory in favor if xml schema files and a installer class defined in install.php.

general notes
  - moved all config parameter handling inside the containers into init() methods
  - reworked RC4 handling into cryptRC4() method
  - fixed bug in LiveUser_Perm_Storage_XML::mapUser() method which would result
    in read issues if the user is not the first user in the xml file
  - moved authTableCols from the database containers into common
  - added conversion of PEAR errors to error stack in several places
  - disable password checks in the auth containters if password is set to false
    in the authTableCols config option
  - some cleanups and refactoring to add support for the authTableCols fields
    in the XML container like in the database containers
  - added Session auth container that checks a password as set inside the
    session. this could be useful in combination with a CAPTCHA
  - use LIVEUSER_ERROR constant instead of LIVEUSER_ADMIN_ERROR_QUERY_BUILDER
  - added allowEmptyPasswords auth container option
  - added install.php class to handle database schema installation via the MDB2
  - removed sql files from the sql directory
    schema manager to provide support for other RDBMS than only MySQL
  - removed unused userExists() auth container method (use admin interface instead)
  - accept all config parameters by reference inside the containers
  - move readAreaAdminsAreas over to Complex where it should be.
  - the observers mechanism now use PEAR::Event_Dispatcher

auth schema structure
  - handle is now unqiue by default

perm schema structure
  - moved default database structure into separate file (using the GLOBALS super globals)
  - default datatype for auth_user_id should be 'text' (thx Matthias aka Nomatt for spotting)
  - table rights_implied should have been right_implied in the perm schema structure
  - removed has_level from the database schema
  - added area_admin_areas and all it's joins
  - fixed remember me feature in example2
  - remove empty placeholders and block in loadTemplate() calls in example4
  - added translation_id field in liveuser_translations table
  - fixed bug in group subgroup table joining in the schema structure

examples
  - fixed bug in example1 onLogout -&gt; postLogout (bug #3135)
  - fixed php5 issues in example4
  - all examples now have a unique database name by default</notes>

- lazy loading of PEAR::Log

- Fixed auth to perm mapping (also taking into account the auth container name)
- Fix #2538 added LIVEUSER_ERROR_WRONG_CREDENTIALS as an error when credentials are wrong.

                  if there is one or false.
- Fix #2528 LiverUser::Factory calls PEAR::isError. The methods return false and not
  a PEAR_Error so the check is wrong
- Fix #1957 one to many boolean in the type array in getRights.
- Fix #2527 have raiseError in the admin class and change the calls from
  PEAR::raiseError to LiveUser_Admin::raiseError.

      <notes>- in getGroups() in /Admin/Perm DB groups. was appended to the sql query with implode, which
  didn't work for the is_active part since CASE needs to be before groups.is_active
- add check on the third and fourth parameter to avoid a warning from older code in addUser/updateUser in /Admin/Auth
- addUser() in the Admin class has a BC break since it wasn't synced with addUser of Auth
- Same goes with updateUser from the Admin Class
- Making sure that optinalFields and customFields are array in addGroup/editGroup
- When neither optional nor custom array was supplied to addGroup/editGroup/addUser it would fail.
- Removed sql parts which used scope, since we removed it from the create table statements
- Now all implied rights are removed before the right it self is removed
- Now all subgroup assignments are removed before removing the group it self
- Now user is removed after all groups that he/she was owner of has set the owner_user_id to NULL
- When assigning a subgroup now one can't assign a group as it's own parent.
- Bug #2206 fixed, now more then one level of subgroups is displayed and getGroups has been optiomized,
  no more intensive database querying.
- Now if a assigning a subgroup, it gives back a error if the group id and subgroup id have been added before
  in another record, that is if the group id has been added as a subgroup id for the current subgroup id
  (confusing when one explains, but the fix stops a potential silly loop in getGroups)
- Crypt_RC4 wasn't loaded because of a typo
- fixed direct passing of remember parameter to the LiveUser::factory() method
  (fix for bug #2491)
- fixed critical bug in writeable checking inside LiveUser::_storeCookiePasswdId()
  (fix for bug #2492)
- The group table was updated so now group_define_name is default NULL and allows NULL values.
- set proper default type in LiveUser_Admin::addUser()</notes>
